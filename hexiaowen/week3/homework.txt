This paper deals with the problem of audio source separation
using multichannel observation. Utilizing the sparseness of
sound signals in the time-frequency domain is a successful
approach to source separation that enables us to perform separation based on spatial features obtained from a microphone
array. On the other hand, nonnegative matrix factorization
